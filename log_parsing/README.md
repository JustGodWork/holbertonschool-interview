# Log Parsing

This project implements a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics for HTTP log parsing.

## Files
- `0-stats.py`: Reads stdin, parses log lines, and prints statistics every 10 lines or on keyboard interrupt.

## Usage
Run the script and pipe log lines into it. The script prints the total file size and the count of each status code.

## Requirements
- PEP 8 style
- All files executable
